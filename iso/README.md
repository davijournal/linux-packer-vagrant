### What Is This Directory For?

You should download your Linux Server ISO images from mirrors and place them in this folder. We need to do this because ISO images size are big and require time to download with limited internet bandwidth, so place the downloaded ISO here will save your time.

For example, you might want to start with one of the following:

* CentOS Version 6.8 minimal:
	* File Name: CentOS-6.8-x86_64-minimal.iso
	* SHA256 Hash: ec49c297d484b9da0787e5944edc38f7c70f21c0f6a60178d8e9a8926d1949f4
	* Mirrors Download List: http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/6/isos/x86_64/
